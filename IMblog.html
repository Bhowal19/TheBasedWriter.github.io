                <p class="lead">is one of the most reputable and well-known startup after Facebook and Apple. Founded by
                    Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger in the year 2012, Instagram had the potential to surpass its rival
                    Facebook which it did in the future but was bought by Facebook in the same year for 1 Billion USD, a
                    shocking amount of money at that time to buy for a company which had only 13 employees, Mark
                    Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook knew and recognized Instagram as a ’threat’ and hence bought it.
                    A wise decision as expected from Zuckerberg, as of today Instagram has one Billion monthly active
                    users and five hundred million daily active users generating an advertising revenue of around $20
                    Billion, according to a direct marking agency, Omnicore. Instagram was also claimed to have been
                    worth a hundred billion dollars by 2018 according to a Bloomberg Intelligence report.</p>

                <p class="lead">The original difference of Instagram is that it only allows frame selection of a post
                    with a 1:1 square aspect ratio and 640 pixels to match the screen width of the iPhone at the time.
                    In 2015, these limitations were fought back and resolved with markers up to 1080 pixels. They also
                    added messaging features, direct message (DM) as we know today along with the ability to include
                    multiple images or videos in a single post and also adding 'stories' feature.

                Akin to its main rival Snapchat which allows users to post photos and videos in a sequential stream,
                each accessible to each post for 24 hours. From January 2019, the Stories feature on Instagram is being
                used by 500 million daily users. Instagram was originally released for iOS in October 2010, with 1
                million registered As of June 2018, 10 million users per year, 1 billion users in 2 months. It gained
                popularity at high speed. 
                The Android version of Instagram was launched in April 2012, followed by limited features in November
                2012, Fire OS apps in June 2014, and Windows 10 in October 2016, and desktop interface. As of October
                2015, over 40 billion photos have been uploaded. Instagram has received praise for its influence but has
                been criticized for policy and interface changes, suspicion of censorship, and illegal or inappropriate
                content uploaded by users.

                Instagram Marketing
                <br>
                Now behind Facebook , Instagram is the second most accessed network.
                <br>
                When it first appeared in 2010, Instagram was filled with posts of selfies, pets, food, and other
                miscellaneous items just like any other social media platform. Going to 2019, Instagram's migration to
                becoming a head-on marketing channel is almost complete with a simple photo-sharing app. Let's take a
                look at the latest features of the platform. last year alone Instagram has released dozens of new
                Instagram features including shoppable Instagram posts, advanced analytics, new ways to drive traffic
                from Instagram Stories, and the new platform-independent video platform, IGTV.
                <br>
                The proliferation of brands that have developed a presence on the platform has exploded. 71% of US
                businesses use Instagram, an estimate by Oberlo. It's clear that Instagram is no longer used for
                personal purposes. It's now a global platform where brands can recruit content, new talent, venture
                their products and embolden their audience. Plus, the Instagram users are not bustling but they are
                actively participating Roughly 59% of active platform users visit the site every day, spending at least
                a few hours a week browsing content and interacting with friends and brands. Instagram also helps
                increase brand awareness and introduce new products. Every month, 130 million Instagram users
                participate in shopping content. With Instagram, you can promote your brand or product in a friendlier
                and familiar way, without forcing the customers to buy your produc
                <br>
                Why market on Instagram
                <br>
                Instagram's visual nature is its main advantage over other social media platforms Either one has a
                business that benefits from product design or a service that has a visible result, Instagram’s the ideal
                platform to showcase that content
                <br>
                Video, images, and illustrations are all good content suitable for social media platforms, but marketing
                strategies determine the type and frequency of content to be published in the end. Develop a strategy
                before jumping into a new social media platform, determine how effective it is for everyone else's
                business, but you can focus on your goals the most important audience.
                <br>
                Businesses growing through Instagram Marketing
                <br>
                What sets Instagram apart on social media platforms is that it allows businesses to display their
                products without public advertising. As Kissmetrics said, "In a scenario, you can remove a scary used
                car salesman because viewers don't feel the pressure of the business and can make their own decisions."
                Good brands show off their products very easily and create creative images.Throgh their strategy and
                knowledge these brands have been able to make it through Instagram. These small businesses running

                            Bien Cuit Bakery takes its inspiration from the phrase "biencuit", which the French most
                            often use to refer to the darkest and most chewy bread. This NYC located bakery aims to make
                            basic dishes like bread special.
                             This mission is also important for Instagram accounts with amazing gilded loaves of bread
                            and sweets. And who doesn't like pictures of delicious food? The pictures are very
