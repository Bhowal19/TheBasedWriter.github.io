            ✴Business E-Mail Compromise (BECA sophisticated scam aimed at companies that regularly perform business or
            bank transfer payments in collaboration with overseas suppliers Fraud is carried out through social
            engineering, computer intrusion technology, in a way that damages legitimate business email accounts and
            executes unauthorized funds.
            <br>
            ✴Ransomware form of malware that targets human and technical vulnerabilities in individual organizations and
            networks to prevent the availability of critical data and/or systems. The ransomware is often delivered to
            end-users via spear-phishing emails, resulting in rapid encryption of sensitive files. When the victim
            organization determines that they can no longer access their data, the cybercriminal demands payment of a
            ransom, usually in virtual currency such as bitcoin, whereupon the actor allegedly offers the victim a way
            to regain access to your data.
            <br>
            ✴E-Mail Account Compromise (EAC): Like BEC, this scam targets the general public and professionals related
            to financial and credit institutions, real estate companies, and law firms. EAC criminals use infected
            emails to request payment from fraudulent locations.
            <br>
            ✴Data breach or leak or spill of records that is launched from a stable place to an untrusted environment.
            Data breaches can arise on the private and company ranges and contain sensitive, protected, or personal
            facts this is copied, transmitted, viewed, stolen, or utilized by a character unauthorized to do so.

            systemsOccasionally coercion manupilation tactics are used by perpetrators to expropriate funding from
            victims.
            <br>
            ✴ Phishing/Spoofing: Both terms alter solid or faked electronic documents. Spoofing typically refers to the
            dissemination of e-mail that is forged to look as if it had been sent by somebody except the particular
            source. Phishing, additionally said as vishing, smishing, or pharming, is usually utilized in conjunction
            with a spoofed e-mail. it's the act of causing an e-mail incorrectly claiming to be a longtime legitimate
            business in a trial to deceive the unsuspecting recipient into divulging personal, sensitive data admire
            passwords, MasterCard numbers, and checking account information when directive the user to go to a such that
            website. The website, however, isn't real and was created solely as a trial to steal the user's data.

            FRAUD detection software:
            <br>
            At the end, when it lands to a fight against internet and online frauds and its prevention and detection,
            the preeminent factor that comes in the spotlight is the speed of the software being used. One ordinarily
            has the opportunity for approximately one second or less to anticipate and prevent a fraudulent transaction.
            though fraud prevention and detection systems usually bolster using analytics to identify unusual patterns
            homogeneous with loan,credit card fraud or money laundering yet due to numerous channels and millions of
            transactions everyday,a fast fraud detection software solution is required to result in the transactions.
            When only 0.3% of these one-second windows are lost, large financial institutions may suffer losses of US$10
            million or more aanually.
            I also read about the Amazon Fraud detection system which also I am quite reputed in the Fraud detection
            system as Amazon itself has approximately 1.6 million packages a day. That works out to more than 66
            thousand orders per hour, and 18.5 orders per second and so it is very intelligible that fraudulent
            activities might occur regularly and to detect those are quite admirable.
            <br>


            Amazon Fraud Detector is a fully managed service that makes it easy to identify potentially illegal online
            activity, including online payment fraud and fake account creation. Amazon Fraud Detector uses machine
            learning (ML) and 20 years of fraud detection expertise from AWS and Amazon.com to automatically identify
            potential fraud in milliseconds. No upfront payments and no long-term effort, no infrastructure managed by
            Amazon FraudDetector. You pay only for your actual use.
            <br>
            Some software which are recently been in the spotlight is as follows


            Coupled with the extremely fast CEP engine, its real-time fraud detection, and prevention technology also
            rely on memory data storage to process and analyze transactions faster, keeping a list of potentially
            fraudulent behavior rules in memory, instead of requiring the system to query the database for each
            transaction, their fraud detection, and prevention solutions enable one to correlate more data with customer
            behavior in real-time, thereby reducing detection time and minimizing losses due to fraud.
            This software is undoubtedly one of the recommendable software to use in the fight against fraudulent
            activities.
